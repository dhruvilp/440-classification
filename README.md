# CS440 - Image Classification Project

In this project, you will design three classifiers: 

1. Naive Bayes Classifier,
2. Perceptron Classifier, 
3. One of these (K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks, or Decision
Trees)

We will be testing and training our classifiers on two image data sets: a set of scanned handwritten digit images and a set of face
images in which edges have already been detected. Even with simple features, our classifiers will be able to do quite well
on these tasks when given enough training data.
